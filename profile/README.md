## What is Storyist?  

**Storyist** is an elegant yet powerful writing suite built specifically for authors, screenwriters, and creative storytellers.  
It provides a balance between the freedom of writing and the structure required to complete professional-quality manuscripts.  

Unlike traditional word processors, Storyist focuses on **narrative development** as much as on text composition.  
Writers can create a complete framework for their story — including **plot outlines, character biographies, location notes, and scene breakdowns** — all within the same project file. This makes it easier to visualize how each part of the narrative connects and evolves throughout the writing process.  

The integrated **corkboard and outline view** allow you to rearrange chapters and scenes with drag-and-drop simplicity, while the **timeline tools** help track events, pacing, and story arcs. For novelists, Storyist supports **multi-view editing**, letting you move seamlessly between your manuscript and planning documents without losing focus.  

The writing experience itself is clean, distraction-free, and fully customizable. Writers can apply **themes, typewriter scrolling, live word count, and full-screen focus mode** to tailor their environment. Each project supports **style templates** for novels, short stories, or screenplays, ensuring consistent formatting for publishing standards.  

For those working across devices, Storyist synchronizes projects through **iCloud, Dropbox, and local storage**, keeping everything up to date. Backup and version tracking features protect your work at every stage, making it reliable for both hobbyists and professionals handling large manuscripts.  

Storyist also integrates easily with **industry-standard publishing tools**, allowing export to **EPUB, DOCX, Final Draft, and PDF**, making it suitable for self-publishing authors, editors, or agents reviewing submissions. Whether you’re crafting a complex novel, a short film script, or serialized fiction, Storyist provides the creative infrastructure to take your ideas from concept to completion with ease.
